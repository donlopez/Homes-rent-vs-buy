# Rent vs. Buy Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze Zillow housing data to provide insights into whether it is more advantageous to buy or rent a property in 2024. The analysis is conducted using Python, and the findings are presented through various visualizations and graphs.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Zillow and includes relevant information about housing prices, rental rates, and other key factors. The dataset is available in the `datasets` directory.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main sections:

1. **Data Exploration and visualizations:**
   - Jupyter Notebook: [data_exploration2.ipynb](notebooks/data_exploration2.ipynb)
   - This notebook explores the dataset, examining features such as property prices, rental rates, and market trends.
   - Jupyter Notebook: [data_exploration.ipynb](notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb)
   - The analysis notebook delves into specific questions, such as:
     - What are the current trends in housing prices and rental rates?
     - How do these trends vary across different regions?
     - Is it financially more beneficial to buy or rent in 2024?

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Other required libraries (listed in requirements.txt)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/donlopez/homes-rent-vs-buy.git
   cd homes-rent-vs-buy
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook files in the `notebooks` directory to explore the dataset and analyze the data.

3. Run the code cells in the notebooks to generate visualizations and obtain insights.

4. Review the visualizations in the `visualizations` directory to gain a better understanding of the analysis results.

5. Use the findings from the analysis to make informed decisions about whether to buy or rent a property in 2024.
